Tag Validation
==============

I thought it would be interesting to perform an audit of the observed tags against
the OSM wiki features (i.e. essentially the of best practice keys/tags)

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features

After a little research I determined that the simplest way of obtaining an machine usable extract was
to use the download available from Taginfo:

http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/download

This was available in a Sqlite3 database form so I did the following in order to extract files containing
the keys and tags for lookup:

- installed Sqlite3

sudo apt-get install sqlite3

- downloaded the data

wget http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/download/taginfo-wiki.db.bz2
bunzip2 taginfo-wiki.db.bz2

- started the database

sqlite3 taginfo-wiki.db

- explored the schema

.tables
.schema wikipages_tags
.schema wikipages_keys

- looked at the data

select * from wikipages_keys;
select * from wikipages_tags;

- dumped the data to csv

sqlite> .output keys.csv
sqlite> select * from wikipages_keys;
sqlite> .output tags.csv
sqlite> select * from wikipages_tags;

*************************************

can't see a way of doing a enrichment/filter
by query (i.e. using tags/keys tables) in Mongo
so just  do it in python

Do it in a separate job or do it during load?????
(separate I think)
